Platforms like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) train their recommender systems by understanding user interest from their interaction history. 
In the normal days, no problem. 
But during extraordinary events like [the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), people tend to exhibit unusual behavior, such as [panic buying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_buying). 
My work is to differentiate between genuine user interests and irrational behavior, in order to improve the quality of recommendations.
