abstract: Concept drift in stream data has been well studied in machine learning applications.
  In the field of recommender systems, this issue is also widely observed, as known
  as temporal dynamics in user behavior. Furthermore, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic
  related contingencies, people shift their behavior patterns extremely and tend to
  imitate others' opinions. The changes in user behavior may not be always rational.
  Thus, irrational behavior may impair the knowledge learned by the algorithm. It
  can cause herd effects and aggravate the popularity bias in recommender systems
  due to the irrational behavior of users. However, related research usually pays
  attention to the concept drift of individuals and overlooks the synergistic effect
  among users in the same social group. We conduct a study on user behavior to detect
  the collaborative concept drifts among users. Also, we empirically study the increase
  of experience of individuals can weaken herding effects. Our results suggest the
  CF models are highly impacted by the herd behavior and our findings could provide
  useful implications for the design of future recommender algorithms.
