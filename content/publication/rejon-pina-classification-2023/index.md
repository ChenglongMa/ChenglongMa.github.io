abstract: Objective A growing body of literature reveals that skin color has significant
  effects on people's income, health, education, and employment. However, the ways
  in which skin color has been measured in empirical research have been criticized
  for being inaccurate, if not subjective and biased. Objective Introduce an objective,
  automatic, accessible and customizable Classification Algorithm for Skin Color (CASCo).
  Methods We review the methods traditionally used to measure skin color (verbal scales,
  visual aids or color palettes, photo elicitation, spectrometers and image-based
  algorithms), noting their shortcomings. We highlight the need for a different tool
  to measure skin color Results We present CASCo, a (social researcher-friendly) Python
  library that uses face detection, skin segmentation and k-means clustering algorithms
  to determine the skin tone category of portraits. Conclusion After assessing the
  merits and shortcomings of all the methods available, we argue CASCo is well equipped
  to overcome most challenges and objections posed against its alternatives. While
  acknowledging its limitations, we contend that CASCo should complement researchers.
