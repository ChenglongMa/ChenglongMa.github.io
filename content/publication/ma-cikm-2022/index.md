abstract: We outline a simulation-based study of the effect rapid population-scale
  concept drifts have on Collaborative Filtering (CF) models. We create a framework
  for analyzing the effects of macro-trends in population dynamics on the behavior
  of such models. Our framework characterizes population-scale concept drifts in item
  preferences and provides a lens to understand the influence events, such as a pandemic,
  have on CF models. Our experimental results show the initial impact on CF performance
  at the initial stage of such events, followed by an aggravated population herding
  effect during the event. The herding introduces a popularity bias that may benefit
  affected users, but which comes at the expense of a normal user experience. We propose
  an adaptive ensemble method that can effectively apply optimal algorithms to cope
  with the change brought about by different stages of the event.
