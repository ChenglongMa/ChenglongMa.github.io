abstract: "Many existing recommender systems (RSs) assume user behavior is governed
  solely by their interests. However, the peer effect often influences individual
  decision-making, which leads to conformity behavior. Conventional solutions that
  eliminate indiscriminately such bias may cause RSs to neglect valuable information
  and depersonalize the recommendation results. Also, conformity can transform into
  user interest, e.g., discovering new tastes after a glance at popular music. By
  better representing different forms of conformity influence, we can do a better
  job at interest mining and debiasing. In certain extreme circumstances, the herd
  effect may be exacerbated by user anxiety with uncertainty (e.g., panic buying during
  the COVID-19 pandemic). RSs may thus fail to respond in time due to sudden and dramatic
  changes. Moreover, many existing studies potentially conflate conformity bias with
  popularity bias and lump together various factors responsible for differences in
  popularity. In this paper, we identify two distinct types of conformity behavior:
  informational conformity and normative conformity. To address this, we introduce
  the TCHN model, which utilizes attentional Hawkes processes to disentangle user
  self-interest and conformity in a personalized manner. Our approach incorporates
  temporal graph attention networks to capture users' stable and volatile dynamics.
  We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets, which uncover diverse levels
  of conformity among users. The results show that TCHN excels in recommendation accuracy,
  diversity, and fairness across various user groups."
