	abstract = {We outline a simulation-based study of the effect rapid population-scale concept drifts have on Collaborative Filtering (CF) models. We create a framework for analyzing the effects of macro-trends in population dynamics on the behavior of such models. Our framework characterizes population-scale concept drifts in item preferences and provides a lens to understand the influence events, such as a pandemic, have on CF models. Our experimental results show the initial impact on CF performance at the initial stage of such events, followed by an aggravated population herding effect during the event. The herding introduces a popularity bias that may benefit affected users, but which comes at the expense of a normal user experience. We propose an adaptive ensemble method that can effectively apply optimal algorithms to cope with the change brought about by different stages of the event.},

	abstract = {Concept drift in stream data has been well studied in machine learning applications. In the field of recommender systems, this issue is also widely observed, as known as temporal dynamics in user behavior. Furthermore, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic related contingencies, people shift their behavior patterns extremely and tend to imitate others' opinions. The changes in user behavior may not be always rational. Thus, irrational behavior may impair the knowledge learned by the algorithm. It can cause herd effects and aggravate the popularity bias in recommender systems due to the irrational behavior of users. However, related research usually pays attention to the concept drift of individuals and overlooks the synergistic effect among users in the same social group. We conduct a study on user behavior to detect the collaborative concept drifts among users. Also, we empirically study the increase of experience of individuals can weaken herding effects. Our results suggest the CF models are highly impacted by the herd behavior and our findings could provide useful implications for the design of future recommender algorithms.},

	abstract = {Objective A growing body of literature reveals that skin color has significant effects on people's income, health, education, and employment. However, the ways in which skin color has been measured in empirical research have been criticized for being inaccurate, if not subjective and biased. Objective Introduce an objective, automatic, accessible and customizable Classification Algorithm for Skin Color (CASCo). Methods We review the methods traditionally used to measure skin color (verbal scales, visual aids or color palettes, photo elicitation, spectrometers and image-based algorithms), noting their shortcomings. We highlight the need for a different tool to measure skin color Results We present CASCo, a (social researcher-friendly) Python library that uses face detection, skin segmentation and k-means clustering algorithms to determine the skin tone category of portraits. Conclusion After assessing the merits and shortcomings of all the methods available, we argue CASCo is well equipped to overcome most challenges and objections posed against its alternatives. While acknowledging its limitations, we contend that CASCo should complement researchers. toolkit in this area.},
